# Website for COLDPLAY band

A webpage for the Coldplay band, created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It contains interactive elements like a slideshow and buttons to display different content on the page. When submitting to sign up, the details are added to local storage.

## Description

The purpose of this project is to develop a webpage and demonstrate skills in styling and coding interactivenes. Using data stored in array I manage to create functionality by extracting different content. I utilized various array methods and storing data from form data in local storage. Due to time constraints, I focused more on making the webpage simple yet interactive.
